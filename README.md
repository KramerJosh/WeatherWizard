# Deploying
For this program to work, you should deploy to a site like render, which can be done by linking your gitHub account.

# Usage
Once everything is up an running, usage is very straight forward.  
Navigate to the URL the site is hosted on, in this case that would be:
https://weatherwizard-212z.onrender.com

You can enter a new city to check the weather of in the text field, or click on an existing city.

# Technology
This program makes calls to the open weather API, uses gitHub to store the repository, and Render to host the webservice.
